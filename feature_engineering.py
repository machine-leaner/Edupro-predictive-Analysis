Builds the final course-level analytical dataset used for modeling.

Key design decisions (documented per project requirements):

1. Unit of analysis: one row PER COURSE. EnrollmentCount and TotalRevenue
   are course-level aggregates of Transactions, which is what Phase 7 asks
   us to predict.

2. Course <-> Teacher relationship: Phase 1 found this is many-to-many and
   only exists inside Transactions (Courses/Teachers have no direct link).
   So teacher features are computed as HISTORICAL AGGREGATES over the
   instructors who taught a course's transactions, not a static 1:1 join.

3. No leakage: because the "historical teacher aggregate" and "historical
   enrollment/revenue" features are themselves derived from Transactions,
   we compute them using a chronological cutoff. Transactions up to and
   including the cutoff date build the FEATURES; the modeling TARGET
   (EnrollmentCount / TotalRevenue) is computed over a later, disjoint
   window. This mirrors a realistic forecasting setup: "given what we know
   about a course through time T, predict its enrollment/revenue in the
   following period." See PHASE7_TARGET3 notes at the bottom.

4. For the primary (non-forecasting) TARGET 1 / TARGET 2 models, described
   in the project as "predict EnrollmentCount / TotalRevenue" for a course
   from its static attributes, we build a full-history course-level
   dataset. Static course/teacher-pool attributes (price, duration,
   rating, category, average instructor profile) are not "future
   information" relative to the target in the sense scikit-learn cares
   about (they're properties of the course/instructor pool as a whole,
   known at catalog time) - this is called out explicitly, since the
   distinction between "descriptive aggregate of the same transactions
   being counted" and "leakage" matters for interpretation. We are
   transparent about this in the report: Target 1/2 models answer "what
   course/instructor profile is associated with higher demand and
   revenue?" (an association / catalog-design question), while Target 3
   answers the harder, leakage-safe forecasting question ("given history
   through month M, what happens in month M+1?").
